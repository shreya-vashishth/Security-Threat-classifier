🚨 INCIDENT PRIORITY CHECKER


📌 OVERVIEW

This project is part of my internship application task. The goal is to build a text classification model that predicts the priority level of incidents (e.g., fire, power outage, flood, streetlight issues) based on short text descriptions.
The classifier is implemented using multiple machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, with TF-IDF vectorization for text representation.

📊 MODELS USED

Naive Bayes

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Each model was trained and evaluated, and their performance was compared using classification reports (precision, recall, F1-score).


🚀 How to Run
1. Open `CLASSIFIER.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab.
2. Run all cells to train and evaluate the models.
